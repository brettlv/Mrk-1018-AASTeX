%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.3 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.3
\documentclass[twocolumn]{aastex63}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are five other style options available via an optional argument. 
%% They can be invoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[arguments]{aastex63}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Preferred style for Research Notes which are by design 
%%                lacking an abstract and brief. DO NOT use \begin{abstract}
%%                and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can invoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%   astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%   tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                  the twocolumn substyle.
%%   times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%   linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%   longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                  the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                  affiliation information after each name. Creates a much 
%%                  longer author list but may be desirable for short 
%%                  author papers.
%% twocolappendix : make 2 column appendix.
%%   anonymous    : Do not show the authors, affiliations and acknowledgments 
%%                  for dual anonymous review.
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex63}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%% \hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003

%% For manuscript that include authors in collaborations, AASTeX v6.3
%% builds on the \collaboration command to allow greater freedom to 
%% keep the traditional author+affiliation information but only show
%% subsets. The \collaboration command now must appear AFTER the group
%% of authors in the collaboration and it takes TWO arguments. The last
%% is still the collaboration identifier. The text given in this
%% argument is what will be shown in the manuscript. The first argument
%% is the number of author above the \collaboration command to show with
%% the collaboration text. If there are authors that are not part of any
%% collaboration the \nocollaboration command is used. This command takes
%% one argument which is also the number of authors above to show. A
%% dashed line is shown to indicate no collaboration. This example manuscript
%% shows how these commands work to display specific set of authors 
%% on the front page.
%%
%% For manuscript without any need to use \collaboration the 
%% \AuthorCollaborationLimit command from v6.2 can still be used to 
%% show a subset of authors.
%
%\AuthorCollaborationLimit=2
%
%% will only show Schwarz & Muench on the front page of the manuscript
%% (assuming the \collaboration and \nocollaboration commands are

%%
%% Note that all of the author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable. Please do not use
%% this functionality for manuscripts with less than 20 authors. Conversely,
%% please do use this when the number of authors exceeds 40.
%%
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.
%% This command should only be used with \AuthorCollaborationLimit is used.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It

\title{Long term multi-wavelength evolution of Changing-Look AGN: Mrk~1018}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire. In v6.3 you can include a footnote in the title.

%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
%% calling author and affiliations. The change was necessary to implement 
%% auto-indexing of affiliations which prior was a manual process that could 
%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
%%
%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
%% argument which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
%%
%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
%% the ID to make sure it is valid. If the "orcid-ID.png" image file is 
%% present or in the LaTeX pathway, the OrcID icon will appear next to
%% the authors name.
%%
%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.3 will automatically index these in the header.
%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
%%
%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple 
%% \affiliation calls for to document more than one affiliation.
%%
%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
%% the proper location.
%%
%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new
%% \correspondingauthor command is available in V6.3 to identify the
%% corresponding author of the manuscript. It is the author's responsibility
%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
%%
%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation
%% commands it is better to have a single author for each. This allows for
%% one to exploit all the new benefits and should make book-keeping easier.
%%
%% If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.

\begin{abstract}
We present multi-wavelength and long-term evolution of Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL AGN), Mrk~1018. Before fading into the faint state, it shows rapid variability in X-ray and optical band. While Mrk~1018 shows strong correlation between UVOT and X-ray band, the flux in UVOT varies more than that in X-ray as a whole but reverses during type transition within short timescale. The type transition timescale for Mrk~1018 is around 2 years(between 2013--2015) or less, while the minimum timescale for variability can be as short as $\sim$ 100 days during transition and several days in the faint state. The photon index($\Gamma$) indicating the hardness in X-ray and $\alpha_{OX}$ representing the relative strength of ultraviolet to X-ray, both appear as ``V-shape'' when compared to luminosity. We find that $\alpha_{OX}-L_{UV}$ diagram is well linked to type of Mrk~1018 in comparison with other CL AGNs. However, only weak variability appears in the radio band, makes it hard to understand the mechanism of radio emission.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro} 
Unified active galactic nucleus (AGN, hereafter) scheme can be described as a phenomenon that different AGN types are determined by the effect of different inclinations relative to the line of sight \citep[see][]{1993ARA&A..31..473A}. Under this scheme, Seyferts are first classified as Type I or II, depending on the emission lines shown by their spectra. Type I (S1) AGNs, show broad lines, allow lines and narrower forbidden lines, could be face-on to observer, while Type II (S2) AGNs show only both permitted and forbidden narrow lines, which could be edge-on and blocked by surrounding torus. Sub-classes(e.g. Seyfert 1.5, 1.8 and 1.9) are introduced by \citet{1976MNRAS.176P..61O,1981ApJ...249..462O} based on the relative weaker ratio of broad-line components to the narrow-line component. For type 1.9, only $H\alpha$ line appears in the broad-line components. 

However, several AGNs, which are discovered to change their source classification (so called changing-look AGNs) within timescale of years, are challenging the AGN Unification Model. The discussion about whether the type transition on such short timescale is related to activeness of central engine or obscuration event is still continuing. 

Mrk~1018 at z=0.042436 is known to be a changing-look AGN, which has undergone a full cycle with twice type transition. \citet{1986ApJ...311..135C} reported that the type of Mrk~1018 transited from S1.9 to S1 between 1979 and 1984. \citet{2016A&A...593L...8M} reported that Mrk~1018 returned to S1.9 between around 2013 and 2015 after 30 years as a S1 \citep[see also][]{2017A&A...607L...9K}. %A tidal eruption event could not account for the Mrk 1018's type change. 
As reported in \citet{2016A&A...593L...9H}, during 2010-2016, the optical continuum brightness and X-ray flux drops by a factor of $\sim$ 17 and $\sim 8$, respectively, with no intrinsic absorption in the X-ray spectrum detected. 

%An explanation of obscuration event for the variability is ruled out, since no intrinsic absorption in the X-ray spectrum is detected. It comes to the conclusion that change of type is consistent with declining accretion rate. \citet{2017A&A...607L...9K} reported the mini-outburst of Mrk~1018 in October 2016 with the brightening by a factor of 1.9 at least to February 2017. Far-UV continuum flux also increased by a factor of 1.5 in around one year during the outburst. It seems that radiation of corona and accretion disk comes from near region. We notice that Mrk~1018 has also experienced the re-brightening during the types transition period simultaneously in X-ray and UVOT band by a factor of $\sim3$ and $\sim1.3$, respectively, between 2013 Mar and 2013 Jun. With broad-band spectrum fitting in two states, \citet{2018MNRAS.480.3898N} suggests the drop of soft X-ray excess contributing most ionizing photons causes the disappearance of Broad Line Region(BLR) then the type transition. \citet{2018ApJ...861...51K} models the broad-line component with a recoiled super-massive black hole scenario with a $\sim$29 years orbital period and predicts that if the type transition repeats as past, it would occur again in mid-2020s. Before that, what the mechanism for such short-timescale light curve variability for AGN and type transition is remains unclear. 

In this work, we perform an extensive data analysis to study the luminosity and spectral evolution of Mrk~1018 at X-ray, optical/ultraviolet and radio bands. This paper is structured as followings: In \autoref{sec:data}, we describe the observations and data reduction in X-ray, optical/ultraviolet and radio bands. In \autoref{sec:result}, we present multi-wavelength observation results. In \autoref{sec:discussion}, we discuss possible explanations for the observation of Mrk~1018. Hereafter, we adopt $H_0$=70 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$, $\Omega_{m}$=0.3, and $\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.7 $ as cosmological parameters, luminosity distance at 187 Mpc and the latest black hole (BH) mass measurement $\log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=7.84$ \citep{2017MNRAS.472.3492E,2018MNRAS.480.3898N}.

\section{Data Analysis}\label{sec:data}
\subsection{X-ray}
We analyse all the public archival data of \swift, \xmm, \chandra and \nustar during 2005--2018. During the X-ray spectral fitting, the column density $n_{\rm{H}}$ is fixed at 0.0243 $\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ since the intrinsic absorption is negligible \citep[see ][]{2016A&A...593L...9H}. The 2--10~keV fluxes are calculated by {\it cflux} component within {\scriptsize XSPEC} (v12.10). All the X-ray observation information and best fit parameters including photon index ($\Gamma$, hereafter), unabsorbed flux in 2--10~keV ($F_{\rm{2-10~keV}}$) are listed in \autoref{tab:table1}. The long term X-ray light curve in 2--10 keV is shown in \autoref{fig:multi-lc-secondaxis}.


\subsubsection{\swift/XRT}
The X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on board the \swift satellite has the most frequent X-ray observations of Mrk~1018. We process all the archive data of \swift/XRT observations performed in photon counting mode with {\scriptsize XRTPIPELINE}\footnote{\url{http://swift.asdc.asi.it}}. The source region is a circle centered at the nucleus of Mrk 1018, the radius of which is determined by the count rate of each observation according to \citet{2009MNRAS.397.1177E}. We use {\scriptsize XSELECT} to extract the source and background spectra. When the counts of an XRT spectrum is less than 200, we use C-stat method for fitting with minimum one count per bin. Otherwise, the spectrum is grouped by minimum of 20 counts per bin and fitted with Chi-stat method. All the XRT spectra of Mrk~1018 in 0.5--10~keV range are fitted with an absorbed power-law model. 


\subsubsection{\chandra/ACIS-S}
There are 6 Chandra observations released in archive. We extract all the ACIS-S spectra with CIAO (v4.10) \footnote{\url{http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/threads/index.html}} and {\scriptsize CALDB} (v4.1). The selection of source and background regions follows \citet{2017ApJ...840...11L}. For observation in 2010 (ObsID 12868), the pile-up effect should be carefully taken into account. We notice that different treatments on the pile-up effect are adopted \citep[see ][]{2017ApJ...840...11L,2016A&A...593L...9H,2017A&A...607L...9K}. Here we exclude the brightest 9 pixels following \citet{2016A&A...593L...9H} for this observation. Then all the spectra in 0.5--10~keV range are grouped by minimum of 20 counts per bin and fitted with an absorbed power-law plus a gaussian component. 

%For this observation, the selection of source and background regions  are followed \citet{2017ApJ...840...11L}.  takes into account the pile-up effect with a JDPILEUP component and get the  $\Gamma =1.97_{+0.04}^{-0.03}$. It's similar to our result $\Gamma =2.02\pm{0.03}$ when we adopt the same pile-up model. \citet{2016A&A...593L...9H} excluded the brightest 9 pixels to avoid pile-up effects and get a lower $\Gamma =1.68\pm0.04$ determined from 4-8 keV range spectrum. The correction for pile-up effects will make the spectrum softer. \citet{2017A&A...607L...9K} ignored the pile-up effects and get a similar $\Gamma =1.7\pm0.03$ fitting in 0.5-8 keV. The fitting range selection will also influence the parameter $\Gamma$. So we adopt values from \citet{2017A&A...607L...9K} for the observation in 2010(MJD 55527).

\subsubsection{\xmm/EPIC-PN}
Only 2 observations from \xmm have been released, which are in 2005 (ObsID 201090201) and 2008 (ObsID 554920301), respectively. We reprocess the PN data with {\scriptsize EPPROC} in SAS-16.1.0.\footnote{\url{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton}}. The spectrum is grouped by minimum of 30 counts per bin and fitted in the 2--10~keV range based on an absorbed power-law model. 



\subsubsection{\nustar}
There are 5 public observations of \nustar in the archive, which are processed through the {\scriptsize NUPIPELINE} task of the {\scriptsize NUSTARDAS} package. The source region is a 50-arcsec-radius circle at the center of AGN, and background is extracted from region off source. The spectrum is grouped by minimum of 30 counts per bin and fitted in the 3--79~keV range with an absorbed power-law model.


\subsection{Optical/ultraviolet}
\subsubsection{\swift/UVOT}
There are six filters in optical/ultraviolet band of \swift/UVOT: V,B,U,UVW1,UVM2 and UVW2. We use the tool \textit{uvotsource} to do the aperture photometry for each filter of all the observations. The source aperture radius is 5$\arcsec$ and the background is chosen in a blank region with much larger aperture radius. The UVOT fluxes are corrected for the Galactic extinction with \texorpdfstring{E(B$-V$) = 0.03645} \citet{2018MNRAS.480.3898N} and $R_{V}=3.1$. Then we calculate  $A_{\lambda}$ by using extinction curve from \citet{2007ApJ...663..320F} for U, UVW1, UVM2, and 
UVW2 band as 0.31, 0.35, 0.25, and 0.18, respectively. 

According to the spectrum of the host galaxy of Mrk 1018 in \citep{2018MNRAS.480.3898N}, we discard all the results of V and B bands since the emission of which are dominated by the host galaxy even in the bright phase. We also find that the emission from the nucleus at other filters are similar to or less than the host galaxy after 2016 \citep{2018MNRAS.480.3898N}, which is consistent with that the UV flux become nearly constant after 2016 (see \autoref{fig:multi-lc-secondaxis}).

\subsection{Radio}
%\label{subsec:vla}
%\subsubsection{VLA}
We search all the historical VLA observations on Mrk~1018 within the field of view. We analyse the data with CASA version 5.3.0\citep{2007ASPC..376..127M}. For data reduction of the old VLA data (project AU0020, AB0476, AB0540 and AB0878), we manually flag and calibrate the data, then clean the image following the instruction\footnote{\url{https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/VLA_5_GHz_continuum_survey_of_Seyfert_galaxies}}. For all the JVLA data(project 16A-444, 16B-084), calibrations are performed using script EVLA\_pipeline1.4.2\footnote{\url{https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/vla/data-processing/pipeline/scripted-pipeline}}. Different bands are split into different MS files after pipeline calibration and RFI check. Then the source is imaged using TCLEAN method and flux is estimated via IMFIT task. The flux density uncertainty is calculated as $\sigma_{S}=\sqrt{(rms)^2+(0.05\times S)^2}$, where $5\%$ absolute flux error is taken into account. Radio spectral index $\alpha$ is estimated following $S_v \propto v^{-\alpha}$. Results and survey data in FIRST\citep{1994ASPC...61..165B,1995ApJ...450..559B} and Stripe 82\citep{2011AJ....142....3H} from archival papers are listed in Table.~\ref{tab:tableradio}.

Multi-band light curve of Mrk~1018 is shown in \autoref{fig:multi-lc-secondaxis}. During the main decay phase($\sim 2004-2016$), brightness in X-ray and UVOT band drops by a factor $\sim20$ and $\sim9$ in 12 years. During the transition phase($\sim 2013-2015$), we find that brightness in X-ray and UVOT band increases by a factor $\sim3.2$ and $\sim1.4$ in 100 days and then drops by a factor $\sim4.2$ and $\sim2.5$ in 400 days. X-ray flux shows strong correlation with UVOT data during the main decay phase. The spearmanr coefficiency between simultaneous flux of xrt and four uvot band(uvm2,u,uvw1,and uvw2) are 0.99, 0.9, 0.86, 0.94, respectively. We find an outlier in \autoref{fig:correlation-uvot-xray} since the flux during this period in x-ray and four uvot band(uvm2,u,uvw1,and uvw2) increases by a factor of $\sim 3.2$ and $\sim 1.2$, $\sim 1.2$, $\sim 1.4$, $\sim 1.5$, respectively, from MJD 56352 to 56450. Then the flux fades by a factor of $\sim 4.2$ and $\sim 3.3$, $\sim 1.8$, $\sim 2.5$, $\sim 3$, respectively, from MJD 56450 to 56817. The slopes between log($F_{2-10keV}$) and four band log($\lambda F_{\lambda}$) are 1.7, 1.1, 1.5, 1.8, respectively, after excluding the outlier. Mrk~1018 shows rapid variability in X-ray within days with a factor of $\sim3$ when it is in faint state (after 2016) (see \autoref{fig:x-ray-lc-rp-secondaxis}). Root Mean Square($\sigma^2_{rms} = 0.047 \pm 0.026 $) of X-ray light curve in faint state is estimated according to \citet{1999ApJ...524..667T}. Flux in radio band decreases by 20 percent from MJD 57481 to MJD 57719 after the type transition, while the whole light curve shows only weak variability by a factor of less than 2.

\subsection{Evolution of ~\texorpdfstring{$\Gamma$}. and ~\texorpdfstring{$\alpha_{OX}$}.~ with Eddington rate \label{subsec:g-f}}
We use the $\Gamma$ in X-ray and \alphaox ~ as probe to trace the relationship between corona and accretion disk during the type transition of Mrk~1018. Here we define \alphaox as :
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{OX}  = - \frac{\log(\lambda F_{2600 \angstrom}/\nu F_{2keV})}{\log(\nu_{ 2600 \angstrom }/\nu_{2keV})}+1
\end{equation}
The flux is converted by magnitude in the UVW1 filter with central wavelength {2600{$\angstrom$}} and full-width at half max of $\sim 683\angstrom$ \citep{2008MNRAS.383..627P} to estimate $\lambda F_{2500 \angstrom}$ used in other references. Only data before 2014 is used for estimation of $\alpha_{OX}$. Based on all X-ray spectrum fit, we present the photon index evolution with flux and Eddington rate, as shown in \autoref{fig:xrayappendgood-fandg-tmap}. For XRT observations, we only adopt data with 0.75$\le \chi^2_{reduced} \le$1.5. The $\Gamma$ vs Eddington rate diagram shows distinct anti-positive/positive correlation when $L_{2-10~ keV}/L_{Edd}$ below/above the so-called critical Eddington rate around 0.002$\sim$ 0.01. However, we find that it transits in two branches in short timescale(100-800 days). We emphasise that Mrk~1018 increases its flux in X-ray by a factor $\sim3$ from MJD 56352 to 56450, while $\Gamma$ drops from $\sim1.8$ to $\sim1.4$, which appeares in two branches. However, the $\alpha_{OX}$ varies just a little and appears in left branch during the same time. The $\alpha_{OX}$-Eddington rate diagram is in good agreement with two other changing-look AGNs, see \autoref{fig:alpha_ox_luv}. 





\subsection{Correlation between X-ray and radio}\label{subsec:xray-radio}
We adopt data from intervals between X-ray and radio band as short as possible to explore the quasi-simultaneous flux in two bands. The correlation between the radio and X-ray flux is weak with a spearmanr coefficiency: -0.54, since the radio band flux of Mrk~1018 is flat relative to X-ray with a slope $\sim -0.1$ when fitting $log(L_{R})\propto log(L_{X-ray})$, see also \autoref{fig:radio-xray-mass_relation_Plotkin2012}. 




\subsection{Summary of results}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The flux in UVOT and X-ray shows rapid variability and strong correlation except an outlier, but in radio band varies by a factor less than 2, in $\sim$15 years. 

\item Variability timescale is as short as $\sim$ 100-400 days with a factor of $\sim$3-4 during transition state and several days with a factor of 3 in faint state.

\item As the luminosity declines, the spectrum of disk and corona also varies.

\item The photon index $\Gamma-L_{X}$ and $\alpha_{OX}-L_{UV}$ diagram both appear as ``V-shape''. 


\end{enumerate}






\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
\subsection{Spectral Evolution and Changing-look}

The evolution of X-ray photon index and $\alpha_{OX}$ with flux represents anti-positive/positive correlation in two branches (so called ``V-shape''). The V-shape both in $\Gamma-L_{2-10~keV}/L_{Edd}$ and $\alpha_{OX}-\lambda L_{2500\angstrom}/L_{Edd}$ diagram show much similarity with other changing-look AGNs \citep[see ][]{2019arXiv190904676R} and quasars \citep[see][]{2019ApJ...883...76R}. Unfortunately, there is a distinct flux gap between two branches for Mrk~1018 which could be caused by lack of observation during the transition period or two intrinsic separate states in Mrk~1018 and the type confirmation from optical spectrum is absent during the type transition phase (in 2013$\sim$2015). The feature in $\Gamma-L_{2-10~keV}/L_{Edd}$ diagram is also found in a large samples of normal AGNs. For example, \citet{2008ApJ...682...81S} finds significant and positive correlation between the hard X-ray photon index ($\Gamma$) and accretion rate ($L/L_{Edd}$) for moderate to high luminosity Radio-Quiet AGNs. The anti-positive correlation of $\Gamma-L_X/L_{Edd}$ in low-accreting AGNs is found with $10^{-10}\leq L_X/L_{Edd} \leq 10^{-3}$ and $10^{-6.5}\leq L_X/L_{Edd} \leq 10^{-3}$, \citep[see][]{2014MNRAS.443...72J,2015MNRAS.447.1692Y}, respectively, while positive correlation of $\Gamma-L_X/L_{Edd}$ is found when $L_X/L_{Edd} \geq 10^{-3}$ \citep[see][]{2015MNRAS.447.1692Y}. X-ray binaries and AGNs share similar anti-positive/positive correlation between X-ray photon index and Eddington ratio below/above a critical value of $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 10^{-2}$ \citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{2007ApJ...658..282Y,2008ApJ...682..212W,2009MNRAS.399..349G,2011A&A...530A.149Y,2015MNRAS.447.1692Y,2019arXiv191203971L,2019arXiv191212145Y}.

The analogous of $\alpha_{OX}-L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$ in X-ray binaries and simulated AGNs spectral states compared to changing-look quasars is also found \citep[see ][]{2011MNRAS.417..280S,2011MNRAS.413.2259S,2019ApJ...883...76R}, which provides another link between stellar-mass black holes and super-massive black holes. As shown in Fig~\ref{fig:xrayappendgood-fandg-tmap} and ~\ref{fig:alpha_ox_luv}, we find that $\alpha_{OX}-\lambda L_{2500\angstrom}/L_{Edd}$ relation is well linked to the types of AGNs when compared with another two Changing-look AGNs.   

What causes the two different branches in $\Gamma-L_{2-10~keV}/L_{Edd}$ diagram is unknown yet. A possible explanation with accretion mode transition has been suggested in Changing-look AGNs \citep[e.g.,][]{2019arXiv191200164A, 2019arXiv191203972L}, the low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) with large amplitude X-ray variability \citep[e.g.,][]{2019arXiv191201897L}, and BL Lac objects\citep[e.g.,][]{2003ApJ...599..147C} with analogous to X-ray binaries\citep[e.g.,][]{2005A&A...442L..15P,2018MNRAS.476.1581A}. If the accretion mode transition corresponds to the type transition, what mechanism makes it occur in such a short timescale is needed. 

Whether the branches in $\Gamma-L_{2-10~keV}/L_{Edd}$ diagram correspond to the types of CL-AGNs is not for sure. But for normal AGNs, there is a random distribution in $\Gamma-L_X$ diagram for type I AGNs when luminosity range is large($\sim 1.78\times 10^{41}-1.53\times 10^{47} erg s^{-1} ; 4.5\times 10^{41}-9\times 10^{44} erg s^{-1}$) \citep[see][respectively]{1997MNRAS.286..513R,2015AASP....5...79S}, while \citet{2008AJ....135.1505S} shows strong and positive $\Gamma-L_X$ correlation in bright radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) when type I and no-type I AGNs are divided into sub-samples with luminosity range from $10^{42}$ to $10^{45} erg s^{-1}$. It seems that anti-positive/positive correlation between $\Gamma$ and X-ray luminosity or Eddington rate below/above the so-called critical accretion rate mainly relies on luminosity and radio properties no matter what the type of AGNs are. \citet{2008ApJ...682...81S} finds that $\alpha_{OX}$ relies on optical-UV luminosity, in radio-quiet (RQ) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), rather than $L_{Bol}/L_{Edd}$, consistent with \citet{2012MNRAS.423..600S} in Type 1 AGNs where optical-UV luminosity mainly drives the X-ray to UV emission ratio, rather than $M_{BH}$ or $L_{Bol}/L_{Edd}$. So it might be $L_{X}$ and $L_{UV}$ that drives $\Gamma$ and $\alpha_{OX}$ in two branches, respectively.

The 2--10~keV flux variability reaches a factor around 8--10 between 2009 and 2016, which is consistent with the dimming of the central engine with zero intrinsic absorption. \citet{2014MNRAS.438.3340E} describes a evolutionary sequence that the AGN type evolution sequence:type 1 $\to$ 1.2/1.5 $\to$ 1.8/1.9 $\to$ 2 as luminosity (or accretion rate onto black hole) decreases in a disc-wind scenario for broad line region. It's consistent with the type evolution of Mrk~1018, despite of lack of optical confirmation in middle type. \citet{2018MNRAS.480.3898N} suggests the drop of soft X-ray excess contributing most ionizing photons causes the disappearance of Broad Line Region(BLR), thus the type transition. $\alpha_{OX}-\lambda L_{2500\angstrom}/L_{Edd}$ relation consistent with another two CL-AGNs supports that the decrease of $L_{UV}$ drives the type transition of Mrk~1018.






\subsection{Characteristic timescale}
 The luminosity of Mrk 1018 starts to decline after a 30-years plateau phase \citep[see][]{2016A&A...593L...8M}. In order to roughly estimate the characteristic decay timescale, we then use an exponential function ($F=S_0\,e^{-(t-t_0)/\tau }$) to fit the X-ray (MJD 53385-58317) and optical/UV (MJD 53587-56818) light curves \footnote{Since the fluxes of the six filters of UVOT are all dominated by the host galaxy after $\sim$ MJD 57429. }. The characteristic decay timescale $\tau$ is obtained as $\sim$2340, $\sim$1510, 1160, 1060, and 1010 days for light curve in X-ray, U, UVW1, UVM2, UVW2 band. Some studies have drew an analogy between the changing-look AGN and the Galactic BH X-ray transits \citep[e.g. ][]{2018MNRAS.480.3898N,2019ApJ...883...76R}. The decay timescale of an outburst of a BH X-ray transit roughly corresponds to the viscous timescale of outer disk \citep[e.g. ][]{1998MNRAS.293L..42K}. Scaling to a $10^{8}M_{\odot}$ BH, the viscous timescale is roughly one million years \citep{2012MmSAI..83..469L,2018MNRAS.475.1190Y}, which is much longer than characteristic decay timescale we got in Mrk 1018. So the declining of the luminosity of Mrk 1018 can not be controlled by the viscous process of the outer disk \citep[see also ][]{2018MNRAS.480.3898N}. 
 
 
 
 Radiation pressure instability plus inner optically thin Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow \citep[see][]{2019arXiv190406767S} provides a possible explanation of outbursts of Changing-look AGN.

We need monitor the multi-band light curve with higher frequency to estimate the time delay of radiation from X-ray and UV/optical.

%The type transition timescale can be limited in $\sim 2$ years, while we find the variability timescale in two X-ray branches can be as short as several months. 
%\subsection{Radio and X-ray}
%Mrk~1018 is located nearly at the transition between two accretion mode, with relatively flat slope in radio and X-ray Eddington rate $\nu L_{\nu}/L_{Edd}-L_{2-10keV}/L_{Edd}$ diagram.
%Mrk~1018 shows relatively flat radio-X-ray relation in the fundamental plane defined in \citet{2012MNRAS.419..267P}.


Summary:
The severe variability of Mrk~1018 in short timescale provides a good target for intrinsic activity of individual Super-massive Black Holes(SMBH). Considering all observational evidence, we can draw a full picture about how Mrk~1018's spectrum evolves with luminosity. As the luminosity declines, both corona and accretion disk varies. The decay timescale  . Furthermore, we need to explore more CL-AGNs and compare them to XRBs and normal AGNs in order to verify the mechanism of rapid variability.
